WFC Overlap Model in Unity
====

This project is a port of the modified WFC algorithm that handles paths. The idea is to extend the algorithm to be able to use it to generate paths on an output map based on an input map which contains paths and obstacles. We used other colors between an obstacle and a path to represent the padding (or rubber space).
